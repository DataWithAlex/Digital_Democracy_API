2024-03-19 12:19:04 - myapp - INFO - main - process_bill_request - 104 - Summary for Webflow: The bill aims to amend sections of the Florida Statutes related to the use or threatened use of force, removing provisions regarding the duty to retreat before using force and prohibiting the use of deadly force when it can be avoided safely. It repeals a section on immunity from prosecution for justifiable use of force, reenacts another section on ownership and possession of firearms, and introduces the "Self-Defense Restoration Act" as the short title. The bill allows the use of force in defense of persons or property, with specific guidelines on the use of deadly force.
